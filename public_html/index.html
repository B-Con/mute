<h1>Mute - An AdBlock Filter</h1>

<p>
Who hasn't innocently started to read the user comments on a newspaper article, blog post, or YouTube video only to deeply regret it? And haven't we all gotten into a time-wasting argument simply because we accidentally noticed <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">someone on the Internet was wrong</a>? We make a mental vow to never read comments again, but alas, we fail.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mute</strong> is an AdBlock Plus filter for user comments. It transparently hides user-generated comments so you can browse the Internet with less stupidity clawing at your eyeballs.
</p>

<p>
Mute removes comments from web pages where they aren't the primary focus, such as YouTube, blogs, and newspapers, but it leaves comments that are the focus, such as user reviews on Amazon and comments on Facebook, reddit, or forums. In short, the goal is to filter out the noise.
</p>

<h2 id="install">Install</h2>

<p>
Mute is an AdBlock Plus add-on filter, so you must first have the <a href="http://adblockplus.org">AdBlock Plus</a> addon installed in your web browser.
</p>

<p>
Add the Mute filter to AdBlock using <a id="install-link" href="abp:subscribe?location=http://mute.bradconte.com/mute.txt&title=Mute Comments" onMouseUp="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Downloads', 'Link', 'mute.txt', 1, true]); return true;">this auto-add link</a>. Alternatively, use <a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/getting_started#add-subscription">these manual steps</a>, summarized here:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click AdBlock and select "Filter Preferences".</li>
  <li>Under the "Filter subscriptions" tab click "Add filter subscription" then "add different subscription".</li>
  <li>At the bottom, choose a subscription title like "Mute Comments" and enter the following into the filter list location: <code>http://mute.bradconte.com/mute.txt</code></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="view-blocked">What if I ever want to view blocked comments?</h3>

<p>
Disabling AdBlock will disable this filter as well. You can disable AdBlock a specific page or an entire site.
</p>

<p>
You can also remove this filter at any time by going into AdBlock and selecting "Filter Preferences > Mute > Actions > Delete".
</p>

<h2 id="contribute">Contribute</h2>

<p>
The filter isn't perfect. Short-comings of the filter are tracked through the project's <a href="https://github.com/B-Con/mute/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>. Everyone is encouraged to add problems that they find with the filter. Create an issue there if:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>something isn't blocked when it should be</li>
  <li>something is blocked when it shouldn't be</li>
</ul>

<p>
and we'll investigate how to fix it. When submitting an issue, you only need to specify the URL with the comment problem (not just the site name or domain, the full URL) and preferably which browser you were using.
</p>

<p>
Contributions to the filter set are welcome. See the <a href="https://github.com/B-Con/mute">GitHub repository</a>.
