{"name":"Mute","tagline":"Mute is an AdBlock filter list for hiding user comments in contexts where they are not the primary focus.","body":"Mute - An AdBlock Plus Filter\r\n===\r\nMute is an AdBlock Plus filter for user comments. It hides user-generated social comments from web pages where the comments aren't the primary focus, such as YouTube, blogs, and newspapers. It does not affect sites where user comments are the primary focus, such as reddit and general forums.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to remove embedded comments from pages where other content is the focus, but leave comments that *are* the focus. For example, comments on YouTube videos and blog posts should be blocked, whereas reviews on Amazon and comments on Facebook or reddit should not be touched. However, Facebook comments embedded in articles on news site should be removed.\r\n\r\nHow To Use It\r\n---\r\nMute is an AdBlock Plus filter, which means that you must first have the [AdBlock Plus](http://adblockplus.org) extention installed in your web browser.\r\n\r\nOnce you have AdBlock installed, [click here to install the Mute filter](abp:subscribe?location=https://github.com/B-Con/mute/blob/master/mute.txt&title=Mute Comments). Alternatively, [manually add the filter subscription](http://adblockplus.org/en/getting_started#add-subscription):\r\n\r\n1. Click AdBlock and select \"Filter Preferences\".\r\n2. Under the \"Filter subscriptions\" tab click \"Add filter subscription\" then \"add different subscription\".\r\n3. At the bottom, choose a subscription title like \"Mute Comments\" and enter the following into the filter list location:\r\n    https://github.com/B-Con/mute/blob/master/mute.txt\r\n\r\n### What if I want to view blocked comments?\r\nYou can disable AdBlock Plus on the page (click AdBlock and select \"disable\" for the current page or site), and all the AdBlock filters, including this, will be disabled.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n---\r\nWho hasn't casually started to read comments on a newspaper article or a YouTube video, only to instantly regret it? How many pointless debates have we been sucked into simply because we accidentally noticed that [someone on the Internet was wrong](http://xkcd.com/386/)? We all make a mental vow to never read comments again, but alas, we fail.\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n---\r\nRequests are tracked through this project's [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/B-Con/mute/issues). Create an issue there if:\r\n\r\n* something is blocked when it shouldn't be\r\n* something isn't blocked when it should be\r\n\r\nWhen submitting an issue, include the URL (not the site name, not the domain, the full URL) and the browser you were using.\r\n\r\nPull requests are welcome.
